## Mobile Marketing Testing

If you have integrated the Mobile credentials for your app project then you can check the progress of your integration by using the install browser.

### Checking installs of your App

When you run your app on a simulator or install your app on a device, you can check that the SDK has been initialized correctly by selecting the app in your Mobile Marketing UI and clicking the `Installs` tab to see the ten most recent installs of your app. Click on any install to see more information.

### Sending test pushes

Once you have run your app on a device or simulator and found it in the `Installs` tab you can send a test push directly to that device,click on an install, click the 'Push' tab and click `Send Test Push`.

If you do not receive the push notification, you can check the Error Log for any errors sending the push notification to the native push gateways by accessing Messaging, Configuration, then selecting the Error Log tab.
